### About me

Hi, I'm a Wonder Woman, kind of... I'm a web-developer. I write my code in JavaScript, and containerize it through Docker files. I also talk to node.js, express, HTML/CSS and both relational and non-relational databases.

Please visit my projects page for more information.

In 2016, I graduated from Texas State University with BS in Computer Science and minored in Applied Mathematics. Its then I decided to try web-development for the first time, and found it to be a path where art and science meet together to create beautiful web-pages.

Being fluent in several languages, I am also providing professional translation and interpretation services at inlingua.Inc since July of 2015. I'm a native speaker of Russian, Kazakh and Uzbek languages.

In my free time, I enjoy spending few hours a day on learning the new skills, exploring the city of Austin, traveling across the country, and spending quality time with my little daughter.
